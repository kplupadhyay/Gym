This project is a Gym Management System developed with React on the frontend and Node.js with Nodemailer on the backend. The application allows users to manage gym memberships, and it features email notifications using Nodemailer. React Toastify is used to display alert messages on the client side.

Usage:-

Sending Emails
To send emails, use the designated API endpoint from the frontend. Ensure that the backend is configured with the correct email service credentials in the .env file.

Notifications
React Toastify is used to display notifications on the client side. Customize the notifications by modifying the ToastContainer and toast calls in the React components
